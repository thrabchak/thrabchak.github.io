Hey there, I'm Tom Hrabchak (pronounced "rab-check"). I grew up in Princeton, NJ and attended the [Peddie School](http://www.peddie.org/page) for high school. I played a lot baseball and eventually became good enough to walk on to my D1 college team at [Bucknell University](http://www.bucknell.edu/) where I studied Computer Science.

I now live in Boston, MA and work for Siemens Product Lifecycle (PLM) Management Software where I help develop [Syncrofit](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/products/syncrofit/syncrofit-overview.shtml). Syncrofit is a cross platform CAD application to manage assembly joining technologies (such as rivets and welds) throughout the design and manufacturing stages of product development.

In my spare time I like to run. I'm training for the Bayshore marathon in late May 2016. I am also an working towards a [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) nanodegree, which you can view on my github page. I sometimes futz around with game development and have participated in the [Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/) for the past two years.

I'm always interested to get involved with new projects, so please feel free to reach out to me if you think I can help you out.
