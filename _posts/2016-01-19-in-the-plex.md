title:  "Book Review: In The Plex"
---
I read Steven Levy's [*In The Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives*](http://www.amazon.com/In-The-Plex-Google-Thinks/dp/1416596585) and enjoyed it so much that I wrote a book review. Levy presents a mostly flattering narrative of Google's history, meanwhile drawing conjectures on why Google succeeded in the majority of their endeavours along the way.

I found Levy's recounts of Google's struggles particularly interesting because it showcased the novel problems that arose from trying to accomplish such lofty and frontier goals.

I wrote the full review on Medium. Here's the link: [The Google Story](https://medium.com/@hrabby/the-google-story-75356b005ca6#.3w3tc2u8a).
